1. Collaborative Filtering (User-to-User)
Takes the current user's ratings and finds users with similar taste patterns
Recommends books that these similar users have rated highly
This is why you see popular books like "Twilight" and "Harry Potter" in the collaborative filtering recommendations
2. Content-Based (Item Features)
This doesn't compare users to users
Instead, it analyzes the features of books the user has already rated (authors, genres, etc.)
Then recommends books with similar features
This is entirely based on book characteristics, not other users' preferences
3. Hybrid Approach
Combines both methods above for balanced recommendations
